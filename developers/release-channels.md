## Stable Channel

This is the default release channel used by SplameiPlay. It's recommended to use this channel if your not developing for SplameiPlay. The Stable channel, as the name suggests, is the most stable with a lot of testing and checks made to prevent as many issues and problems as possible.

## Beta Channel

The Beta channel receives more updates than the Stable channel however, it will contain more bugs and issues however, the Beta channel is tested to fix some of the major problems. It's recommended to be used for those who wish to access new features earlier and do not mind the issue that may occur.

## Alpha Channel

The Alpha channel receives the most updates out of the three channels however, these updates are not tested much meaning that there will be a lot of major issues within releases. It is not recommended to be on this channel unless you are developer who needs access to new features and changes as soon as they are made.
