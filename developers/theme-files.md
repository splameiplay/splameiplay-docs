# Theme Files

In the latest version of SplameiPlay, you can use `.sptheme` files to set the colors that SplameiPlay should used when displaying the background. These themes can be installed and used to further personally SplameiPlay to your liking.

{% hint style="info" %}
When creating custom themes, you shouldn't use light colours as it may make it difficult to see elements of SplameiPlay making navigation harder or impossible
{% endhint %}

Below is an example of a theme file's contents:

```
Type=1.0

Name=SplameiPlay Docs Theme Demo

BckColorOne=663b18
BckColorTwo=8f2c21
```

Place the name of your theme after Name= and the two colors' hex code for the theme after BckColorOne= and BckColorTwo= though making sure the hex does not start with a hashtag (#). The formatting of the hex code must be correct however the capitalisation does not.
