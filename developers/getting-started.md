SplameiPlay, as of 4.0 Bloom, allows developers to publish to SplameiPlay without needing to be directly added in. This is through `.spinstaller` files that gives SplameiPlay information about your project for it to deal with and manage. At the moment, SplameiPlay only has one way to make installer file as shown on the next page.

SplameiPlay, as of 4.2 Bloom, allows users to install custom themes through `.sptheme` files. Currently, only manually creating theme files is supported.
