SplameiPlay, as of 4.0 Bloom, allows developers to publish to SplameiPlay without needing to be directly added in. This is through `.spinstaller` files that gives SplameiPlay information about your project for it to deal with and manage.

SplameiPlay, as of 4.2 Bloom, allows users to install custom themes through `.sptheme` files.

At the current moment, you can only create these files using a notepad application.
