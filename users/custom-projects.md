# Custom Projects

SplameiPlay, as of 4.0 Bloom, has support to add custom projects. Below are the two ways of doing that

## Custom Projects via settings

Go into settings and scroll down until you find the button stating 'Add Custom Project' in the Projects section. Once pressed, SplameiPlay will ask for the location of the file to be opened, the name and author of the project. After you fill this out, the project will be available on the home page.

## Custom Projects via files

SplameiPlay, when installed, can open `.spinstaller` files you download online for more projects then what is originally included.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be careful about what custom projects you download since SplameiPlay won't check for malware that may compromise your computer. Always make sure you trust the developer first
{% endhint %}

Once opened, SplameiPlay will warn you about the dangers of custom projects from an installer file. If your sure you trust the developer, press 'Yes'. SplameiPlay will add the project. You may need to reload the home page to see the change

## Removing custom projects

To remove a project, go on it's project page, scroll down then select 'Uninstall'. This is the same method used for native projects.
