On SplameiPlay 4.0 Bloom and newer, pressing 'Update' will have SplameiPlay download the newest installer and open it so SplameiPlay can keep itself updated.

On versions before 4.0 Bloom, pressing 'Update' will open the official download page and require manually updating.

SplameiPlay should be closed when updating to prevent issues updating
