# Getting Started

Before you can use SplameiPlay you need to install it. You can do that through the [official download page](https://veemo.uk/splameiplay/download/).

Once your own the page you'll want to do the following:

1. Press the download button on the top or bottom of the page.
   1. Though unlikely, your web browser or anti-virus may block the download for the installer. If you can, try allowing the download anyway if supported. You should not disable your AV however.
2. Open the now downloaded `SplameiPlay Installer.exe` file
   1. Windows SmartScreen may trigger warning that the app is 'unrecognised'. This is because SplameiPlay is not widely known. You can safely ignore this message by pressing 'More Info' > 'Run anyway'
3. Follow the steps from the installer to get the app installed correctly. This won't take long
4. When the app is installed, you should see the following screen:

You can now press 'Finish' to close the installer. The app will automatically launch if you had 'Open SplameiPlay' checked. You can also launch it via the Start Menu.

On the initial launch of the app after installing, SplameiPlay Update will download the latest version of SplameiPlay. This process may take some time depending on your internet speeds. Update will launch the app for you once it finishes.
