# Navigating

## Home

When you boot up SplameiPlay, you will see a screen similar to the image provided below:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Home.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The SplameiPlay Home</p></figcaption></figure>

There are three main parts to the SplameiPlay Home UI. There are as follows:

* The side bar that can be found on the left side consisting of the main pages and the 'Hello Text' allowing you to navigate to the Home, Store and Settings page.
* The banner that can be found on the right top side. The image provided above shows the banner reading 'Welcome to SplameiPlay Bloom' When pressed, a project page or link will be opened.
* The main home page that is below the banner. It shows the 3 recently played projects, your favourite projects then below, all the projects you have.

The home is where you can easily launch and update projects you already have installed or custom projects. When you boot SplameiPlay up for the first time, it will be empty. To get new projects, you can try downloading from the Store page that can be opened by pressed 'Store' from the sidebar or via custom projects which can be added via `.spinstaller` files or settings.

## Store Page

Below, you will find what your store page will look similar too:

The Store is where you will download projects. They are split into sections for each of the publishers. You can press the project's button to open it's project page to learn about the project and install / update it.

The store will be growing throughout updates so make sure your install is up-to-date so you can get the latest projects.

## Project Page

Below is what your project page will look similar too:

This is how you launch and install a project. The sidebar can still be accessed to easily change what menu you're on.

On the top right is the notices for the projects. This will show any notices for the project which may be update, events or other similar notices. It will display a message if there are no notices for the project.

On the bottom right of the screen is the Play button for downloading and installing a project. And above it, the favourite button, so you can show the project above your installed projects in the home page.

When you scroll down, you will see more information about the project such as the about text, specs, rating (provided by the project host so it may not be accurate), etc. You can also Uninstall the project or press 'More Info' to to open up the link specified by the project.

## Settings Page

For the settings page, press 'Settings' on the sidebar. For what all the options mean, check the [settings page on these docs](navigating.md#settings-page).
